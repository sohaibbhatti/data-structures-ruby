====================

Going about implementing common datastructures to revise concepts. Test case coverage is present in files with suffix '_spec.rb'. These specs do not ensure code completeness. They merely serve as a means for coding ease. 

### Data Structures Implemented
 * Linked List
   - Insert Node
   - Delete Node
   - Search Node
   - Traverse Nodes
   - Reverse Traversal of Nodes

 * Stacks
   - Using an array to manage two stacks


  ### Data Structures In progress
 * Binary Search Tree
   - Insert Node
   - Delete Node
   - Find Minimum
   - Find Maximum
   - Pre order traversal
   - Post order traversal
   - Traversal

### Data Structures Pipe Line
 * Stack
 * Heap
 * Graph
 * AVL trees
 * Red Black Trees
 

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, feel free to share.
